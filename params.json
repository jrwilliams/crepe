{"name":"Crepe","tagline":"SBSE for your Models","body":"### Search-Based Model-Driven Engineering\r\nCrepe is an extensible framework that enables Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) techniques to be applied to Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) problems. Crepe provides a generic encoding of EMF models that can represent any model conforming to a given metamodel, thus enables many well known metaheuristic optimisation algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms, to be applied in the MDE domain. If the solution to your problem has a metamodel, you can use Crepe. If the parts of your problem are models, but the solution isn't, you can still use Crepe. Out of the box, Crepe provides a simple hill climbing algorithm, a genetic algorithm, and NSGA-II for multi-objective problems.\r\n\r\n### Crepe: Canonical REPresentation for Ecore models\r\nTODO: Explain a bit about the representation - how it works.\r\n\r\n### Why use Crepe?\r\nCrepe makes it easy to apply metaheuristic optimisation to MDE problems. Crepe is general purpose in that it will search over the space of models conforming to any Ecore metamodel. You don't need to develop bespoke metaheuristic operators for your problem; Crepe bootstraps the process allowing you to experiment with the problem domain before investing time in custom operators and algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nDocumentation is a little light at the minute, but take a look at the examples and feel free to contact me at james.r.williams@york.ac.uk if you have any questions.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
